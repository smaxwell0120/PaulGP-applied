\noindent\textbf{Office Hours:} After class, or by appointment. 

\noindent\textbf{Course Description:} This course is primarily designed for
graduate students interested in econometric methods used in empirical
research. The goal of this class is to provide an overview of
different empirical methods, with an emphasis on practical
implementation.  I will provide a set of lecture slides. There are
additional background papers that are optional, but are important if
you want concrete details on the results.

More generally, this is a course where I focus on providing my
understanding and intuition of empirical methods, as they are used by
practicioners. This means that this is not a course where we will
spend a lot of time on the formal details (beyond what is necessary),
but instead focus on the intuitive framework that guides these
papers. I'll also do my best to communciate how any of these topics
fit together.

This is a course very much focused on communication and
artisanship. By the end of the term, my hope is for three things:

\begin{enumerate}
\item You will have been exposed to a wide range of empirical methods,
  and have at least a passing familiarity with their pros and
  cons. Moreover, you will know where to go look if you decide to use
  these methods.
\item Much of the terminology and jargon that we use in econometric
  methods will be less intimidating to you. When someone says ``I use
  semiparametric inference,'' now instead of intimidate you, it will
  bother you that they are not using clearer language.
\item You will approach research papers with the desire to disentangle
  the underlying framework and ``experiment'' that drives their causal
  inferences.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Assignments:}
There will be problem sets most weeks. These will involve both
theoretical calculations and computer exercises in which you will be
asked to analyze data sets. You can use any computer package you wish
to use. Solutions will be handed out written in R. Since there will be
a fair number of problem sets, and in order to allow me to post the
solutions quickly on the webpage for the course, I will not accept
late problem sets. If you anticipate difficulty meeting the deadline,
you can ask me for the problem set earlier to give you additional time
to work on it.

You can work together on the problem sets and discuss them with
classmates, but you need to write up the results individually and hand
them in separately. Grades will be based on the problem sets, divided
evenly over the problem sets.

I expect these assignments to be coded from ``scratch.'' I will
specify when canned packages are appropriate. In other words, when
estimating a regression, I am not looking for the results of
\texttt{lm( y $\sim$ x)}. Rather, I expect you to construct two
matrices and calculate the estimates using this. I also expect you to
attempt to maintain good coding practices while doing so -- this will
likely be challenging for those of you who are inexperienced at
programming, so please plan accordingly -- I will not be providing
additional instruction on coding beyond what I cover in class.  See
the following resources in R for guidance (Many thanks to Max Kasy for
